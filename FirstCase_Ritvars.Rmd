#1.	If C.A.D. can be improved overtime without treatment, there is no real need for Ritalin dosage.  Given	 that the time intervals between the first and second test vary across participants (“INTERVAL”), it is suspected that the baseline improvements are also different.  Propose an estimation model and use your estimation result to address this issue.

model = lm(IMPROVE~INTERVAL+TEST1+TEST1*INTERVAL, data=ritvars_zerodosage)
summary(model)

#Response to #1: I propose to use linear regression model on ritvars data that only has zero dosage, setting interval and test1 values as independent variables and improvement values as dependent variable. The positive coefficient of interval variable shows that C.A.D indeed improve overtime without any dosage of Ritvars. And the negative coefficient of interaction term indicates that the starting condition of a patient truly have a slight influence on the effect of time on the improvement magnitude of a patient. However, the p-value for both coefficients are relatively large. Thus, the inference drew above does not have high significance level. 

#2.	Instead of affecting the baseline improvements, researchers want to investigate the probability that the effect of Ritalin dosage is larger the longer the duration of treatment (represented by “INTERVAL”).  Propose another estimation model and use your estimation result to address this issue.

model2 = lm(IMPROVE~INTERVAL+DOSAGE+INTERVAL*DOSAGE, data=Ritvars)
summary(model2)

#Response to #2: I proposed to use linear regression model that has interval, dosage values, and their interaction term to examine this problem. From the coefficient of interaction term, it seems that the effect of dosage will decrease as interval increases, although the relationship is weak given the p-value is 0.966. And with a large standard error range, the effect of dosage in relation to interval can be zero. Therefore, I conclude that the probability that the effect of Ritalin dosage increases with longer treatment duration is only 4%.

#3.	Researchers suspect that the effectiveness of Ritalin in treating C.A.D. may vary across male and female patients.  Propose an estimation model and use your estimation result to address this issue.

ritvars_withdosage = filter(Ritvars, DOSAGE != 0)
head(ritvars_withdosage)
model3 = lm(IMPROVE~DOSAGE+FEMALE, data=ritvars_withdosage)
summary(model3)

#Response to #3: I applied linear regression model on data that dosage is not 0, where improve as dependent variable and dosage and female as independent variable to address this issue. I think the coefficient of female variable in this model demonstrate the relationship between gender and the effectiveness of Ritalin. Based on the model result, I conclude that there is difference between female and male in terms of their health improvement after using Ritvars. Ritvars has negative effect on female as the coefficient of FEMALE variable is negative with 85% confidence.
